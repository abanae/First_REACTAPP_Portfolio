           <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>My name is Ana and I am a new developer. I've always had an interest in "IT" and I am so eager to practice & learn more. I have previous experience as a Sales Manager, running a $8 million-dollar department store. One of the many things I learned in my previous job is to always be an active listener and communicate effectively with the clients to be able to solve any issues/questions they might have.This will allow the client to build trust and continue business with you. I know with my previous experience and new skills as a developer, I can understand what the client needs and turn it into a well designed and functional website.</p>
